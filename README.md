## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **multi-lingual virtual try-on engine** capable of rendering and simulating apparel on human avatars using high-precision **body landmark detection**. The core pipeline involves:

- Real-time pose estimation  
- 3D body mesh alignment  
- Physically-based cloth simulation  
- DirectML-enhanced parallel rendering

## 📐 Core Features

- 🧠 **Deep Joint Mapping**: Over **60+ anatomical landmark points** tracked and interpolated per frame  
- ⚙️ **Hardware-accelerated**: Optimized for **AMD GPUs** via **DirectML (Direct Machine Learning)**  
- 🧵 **Cloth Deformation Model**: Mass-spring physics + non-rigid ICP alignment for dynamic garment fitting  
- 🧍‍♂️ **Pose-space Deformation (PSD)** for context-aware fitment  
- 📦 **Native C engine** for high-performance threading, with Java bindings for UI and logic integration
